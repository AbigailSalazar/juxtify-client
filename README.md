# Juxtify
Juxtify is an alternative interface for Spotify, based off [Juxtopposed's YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suhEIUapSJQ) redesigning the platform.

This is a heavy W.I.P. and is not yet ready for use. Juxtify is built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on top of [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) for multiplatform compatibility.

    git clone https://github.com/Juxtify4Spotify/juxtify
